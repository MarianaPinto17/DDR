% Exercise: Consider a wireless link between multiple stations for data 
% communications. The bit error rate (ber) introduced by the wireless link 
% (due to the variation of the propagation and interference factors along 
% with time) is approximately given by the following Markov chain:

% % (see guide for more details)

% where the state transition rates are in number of transitions per hour. 
% Consider that the link is in an interference state when its ber is at 
% least 10 -3 and in a normal state, otherwise. Determine:

% 3.a. the probability of the link being in one of the five states; 
% answer: 9.87x10^-1(10^-6 ), 5.48x10^-3(10^-5 ), 2.7410 -3 (10 -4 ), 1.3710 -3 (10 -3 ), 3.4310 -3 (10 -2 )


% 3.b. the average percentage of time the link is in each of the five states; answer:
% 9.8710 -1 (10 -6 ), 5.4810 -3 (10 -5 ), 2.7410 -3 (10 -4 ), 1.3710 -3 (10 -3 ), 3.4310 -3 (10 -2 )


%3.c. the average ber of the link; answer: 3.7010 -5

%3.d. the average time duration (in minutes) that the link stays in each of the five states;
%answer: 60.0 (10 -6 ), 0.30 (10 -5 ), 1.20 (10 -4 ), 2.40 (10 -3 ), 30.0 (10 -2 )

%3.e. the probability of the link being in interference state; answer: 4.8010 -3

%3.f.the average ber of the link when it is in the interference state. Answer: 7.4310 -3
