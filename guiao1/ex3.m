% Exercise: Consider a wireless link between multiple stations for data 
% communications. The bit error rate (ber) introduced by the wireless link 
% (due to the variation of the propagation and interference factors along 
% with time) is approximately given by the following Markov chain:

% % (see guide for more details)

% where the state transition rates are in number of transitions per hour. 
% Consider that the link is in an interference state when its ber is at 
% least 10 -3 and in a normal state, otherwise. Determine:

% 3.a. the probability of the link being in one of the five states; 
% answer: 9.87x10^-1 (10^-6), 5.48x10^-3 (10^-5), 2.74x10^-3 (10^-4), 1.37x10^-3 (10^-3), 3.43x10^-3 (10^-2)
